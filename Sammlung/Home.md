# Home (Mumford and Sons)

```
Capo 5th fret

[Verse 1]
Am     F               C
I ran away in floods of shame
C           G                Am
I'll never tell how close I came
Am     F                C       G
As I crossed the Holland road.

Am             F               C
Where You went left and I went right
C                G           Am
As the moon hung proud and white
Am     F               C             G
You would of loved it here tonight.

[Chorus]
Am                    F
Spin me round just to pin me down
        C                            G
On the cover of this strange bed
Am                  F             C
Spin me round just to pin me down

[Verse 2]
Am              F                C
Wrap up your questions keep them down
C              G       Am
Let the water lead us home
Am     F               C           G
And I was sorry for what I'd done.

Am     F               C
You were young I was not old
C         G            Am
But our story was not told
Am        F              C       G
But torn apart by greedy hands

[Chorus]
Am                    F
Spin me round just to pin me down
        C                           G
On the cover of this strange bed
Am                  F             C
Spin me round just to pin me down

Am                    F
Spin me round just to pin me down
        C                           G
I'll be gone by the night's end
Am                  F             C
Spin me round just to pin me down

G                             F
But I'll be home in a little while
              C
Lover I'll be home
G                             F
But I'll be home in a little while
              C
Lover I'll be home 

G                             F
But I'll be home in a little while
              C         C
Lover I'll be home              X3 til end
