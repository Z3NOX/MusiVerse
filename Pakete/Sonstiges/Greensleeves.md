# Greensleeves

```
 Am      C         G       
Alas, my love, you do me wrong, 
   Am          E       
To cast me off discourteously. 
    Am     C         G     
For I have loved you well and long, 
  Am       E       Am    
Delighting in your company. 
 
 
Refrain: 
G    
Greensleeves was all my joy 
Am               E   
Greensleeves was my delight, 
G     
Greensleeves was my heart of gold, 
    Am         E    Am    
And who but my lady greensleeves. 
 
 
 Am      C              G       
Alas, my love, that you should own 
  Am              E    
A heart of wanton vanity, 
   Am     C         G       
So must I meditate alone 
 Am       E      Am     
Upon your insincerity. 
 
 
Ref. 
 
     Am          C       G       
Your vows you've broken, like my heart, 
    Am             E     
Oh, why did you so enrapture me? 
    Am  C         G       
Now I remain in a world apart 
       Am      E           Am     
But my heart remains in captivity. 
 
Ref. 
 
   Am    C         G       
If you intend thus to disdain, 
   Am              E     
It does the more enrapture me, 
    Am   C     G       
And even so, I still remain 
  Am       E  Am      
A lover in captivity. 
 
Ref. 
 
  Am        C        G       
I have been ready at your hand, 
   Am             E         
To grant whatever thou wouldst crave;, 
  Am        C       G       
I have both wagered life and land, 
     Am       E         Am     
Your love and good-will for to have. 
 
Ref.: 
 
     Am        C       G       
Thou couldst desire no earthly thing, 
    Am                  E     
But still thou hadst it readily. 
    Am    C        G       
Thy music still to play and sing; 
    Am       E           Am      
And yet thou wouldst not love me. 
 
Ref.
