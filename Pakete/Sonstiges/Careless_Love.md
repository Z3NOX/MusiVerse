# Careless Love

```
G        D7                G     
Love, oh love, oh careless love, 
G                          D7 
Love, oh love, oh careless love, 
        G                 C               
Oh it's love, oh love, oh careless love 
    G        D7                G           
You see what careless love has done. 
 
G      D7            G        
Once I wore my apron low 
G                    D7 
Once I wore my apron low 
G                      C             
Oh it's once I wore my apron low, 
      G      D7                  G        
You'd follow me through rain and snow. 
 
G     D7            G               
Now I wear my apron high 
G                   D7 
Now I wear my apron high 
G                     C           
Oh it's now I wear my apron high, 
       G      D7               G             
You'll see my door and pass it by. 
 
  G          D7                    G         
I cried last night and the night before, 
  G                                D7 
I cried last night and the night before, 
     G                        C            
Oh I cried last night and the night before, 
         G      D7              G             
Going to cry tonight and cry no more. 
 
G                 D7       G            
Love, oh love, oh careless love, 
G                          D7 
Love, oh love, oh careless love, 
        G                 C              
Oh it's love, oh love, oh careless love 
    G        D7                G            
You see what careless love has done.
