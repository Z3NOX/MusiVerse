# Aura Lee

```
G                A   
As the blackbird in the spring,  
D7               G               
neath the willow tree, 
G                A   
Sat and piped, I heard him sing;  
D7               G               
sing of Aura Lee. 
G    
Aura Lee, Aura Lee,  
G    
maid with golden hair 
G              A    
Sunshine came along with thee,  
    D7              G               
and swallows in the air. 
 
G                A    
In thy blush the rose was born,  
D7             G               
music when you spake. 
G                   A  
Through thine azure eye, the morn,  
D7                  G               
sparkling seemed to break. 
G                   A  
Aura Lee, Aura Lee,  
G                
birds of crimson wing 
G               A   
Never song have sung to me  
   D7                   G               
as in that night, sweet spring. 
 
G             A     
Aura Lee, the bird may flee  
    D7              G               
the willow's golden hair 
G                    A    
Swing through winter fitfully,  
D7            G               
on the stormy air. 
G               
Yet if thy blue eyes I see,  
G    
gloom will soon depart. 
G                A    
For to me, sweet Aura Lee is  
D7                   G    
sunshine through the heart. 
 
G              A     
When the mistletoe was green,  
D7                 G               
midst the winter's snows 
G               A    
Sunshine in thy face was seen 
D7              G               
kissing lips of rose. 
G    
Aura Lee, Aura Lee,  
G    
take my golden ring. 
G                A   
Love and light return with thee, and  
D7                G               
swallows with the spring.
