# Yankee Doodle

```
G                         D7  
Father and I went down to camp, 
 G                    D7 
Along with Captain Gooding; 
    G                C              
And there we saw the men and boys, 
   D7             G   
As thick as hasty pudding. 
 
Refrain: 
C              D7      G    
Yankee doodle, keep it up, 
D7            G              
Yankee doodle dandy; 
C              D7      G      
Mind the music and the step, 
    D7                G            
And with the girls be handy. 
 
 
G                        D7  
There was Captain Washington 
 G              D7 
Upon a slapping stallion, 
  G             C              
A-giving orders to his men, 
  D7                G           
I guess there was a million. 
 
Ref. 
 
    G                        D7  
And then the feathers on his hat, 
     G                 D7 
They looked so' tarnal fin-a, 
  G           C              
I wanted pockily to get 
   D7           G            
To give to my Jemima. 
 
Ref. 
 
    G                      D7  
And then we saw a swamping gun, 
      G             D7 
Large as a log of maple; 
 G            C              
Upon a deuced little cart, 
  D7                G     
A load for father's cattle. 
 
Ref. 
 
    G                        D7  
And every time they shoot it off, 
   G                  D7 
It takes a horn of powder; 
   G                  C              
It makes a noise like father's gun, 
  D7          G    
Only a nation louder. 
 
Ref. 
 
  G                     D7  
I went as nigh to one myself, 
    G              D7 
As' Siah's underpinning; 
    G              C              
And father went as nigh agin, 
  D7                    G      
I thought the deuce was in him. 
 
Ref. 
 
   G                    D7  
We saw a little barrel, too, 
    G                     D7 
The heads were made of leather; 
     G                    C              
They knocked upon it with little clubs, 
    D7                 G        
And called the folks together. 
 
Ref. 
 
    G                           D7  
And there they'd fife away like fun, 
    G                    D7 
And play on cornstalk fiddles, 
    G                C              
And some had ribbons red as blood, 
    D7                 G     
All bound around their middles. 
 
Ref. 
 
    G                           D7  
The troopers, too, would gallop up 
    G                   D7 
And fire right in our faces; 
G              C              
It scared me almost to death 
   D7                G      
To see them run such races. 
 
Ref. 
 
G                       D7  
Uncle Sam came there to change 
     G                 D7 
Some pancakes and some onions, 
     G              C              
For' lasses cake to carry home 
   D7                G       
To give his wife and young ones.
