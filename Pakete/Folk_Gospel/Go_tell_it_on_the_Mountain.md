# Go tell it on the Mountain

```
      G    
While shepherds kept their watching 
                      D7 
O'er silent flocks by night, 
  G    
Behold throughout the heavens 
      D7           G    
There shone a holy light 
 
 
Refrain: 
G                
Go, tell it on the mountain 
D7                 G    
Over the hills and everywhere 
G                
Go, tell it on the mountain 
     D7              G    
That Jesus Christ is born. 
 
    G    
The shepherds feared and trembled 
     D7            G    
When low! above the earth 
     G    
Rang out the angel chorus 
     D7         G     
That hailed our Saviour's birth; 
 
Ref. 
 
     G     
Down in a lowly manger 
    D7                G    
Our humble Christ was born; 
    G    
And God sent us salvation 
     D7                G    
That blessed Christmas morn 
 
Ref. 
 
     G   
When I was a seeker 
  D7                    G    
I sought both night and day 
  G    
I sought the Lord to help me 
    D7               G    
And He showed me the way. 
 
Ref. 
 
   G    
He made me a watchman 
 D7           G    
Upon the city wall 
    G    
And If I am a Christian 
  D7              G    
I am the least of all.
