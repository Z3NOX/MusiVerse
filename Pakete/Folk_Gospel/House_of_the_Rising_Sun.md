# House of the Rising Sun

```
      Em   G        A     C  
There is a house in New Orleans 
     Em       G      H7 
They call the Rising Sun 
   Em           G       A           C      
It has been the ruin of many a poor girl 
    Em      H7       Em   
And me, oh, God, was one 
 
   Em     G     A  C      
My mother was a tailor, 
    Em         G        H7    
She sewed them new blue jeans. 
   Em       G     A           C       
My lover he was a gambler, Oh Lord 
Em              H7    Em        
Gambled down in New Orleans. 
 
   Em      G     A        C  
My husband was a gambling man 
   Em        G       H7     
He went from town to town; 
        Em   G           A    C      
And the only time he was satisfied 
         Em           H7     Em   
Was when he drank his liquor down. 
 
        Em   G       A            C       
Now the only thing a gambling man needs 
     Em       G     H7  
Is a suitcase and a trunk; 
        Em   G         A         C    
And the only time he's ever satisfied 
  Em        H7   Em   
I when he's on a drunk 
 
Em     G       A    C      
Go and tell my baby sister 
Em       G           B7     
Never do like I have done, 
       Em        G        A     C      
But to shun that house in New Orleans 
          Em       H7     Em   
That they call the Rising Sun 
 
Em       G    A          C  
With one foot on the platform, 
    Em       G      H7    
And one foot on the train 
    Em    G       A     C     
I'm goin' back to New Orleans 
   Em       H7       Em   
To wear the ball and chain. 
 
    Em    G       A     C     
I'm going back to New Orleans 
   Em      G      H7       
My race is almost run; 
    Em    G       A         C    
I'm going back to spend the rest of my life 
  Em         H7     Em   
Beneath that Rising Sun.
