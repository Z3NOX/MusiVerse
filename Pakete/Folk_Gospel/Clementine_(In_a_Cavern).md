# Clementine (In a Cavern)

```
     G         
In a cavern, in a canyon, 
                 D7 
Excavating for a mine, 
        C            G    
Dwelt a miner, forty-niner, 
        D7             G   
And his daughter Clementine. 
 
 
Refrain: 
      G                 
Oh my darling, oh my darling, 
                    D7 
Oh my darling Clementine 
        C                G           
You are lost and gone forever, 
         D7           G  
Dreadful sorry, Clementine. 
 
 
             G                 
2. Light she was, and like a fairy, 
                          D7  
And her shoes were number nine, 
        C             G            
Herring boxes without topses, 
        D7             G          
Sandals were for Clementine. 
 
Ref. 
 
           G          
3. Walking lightly as a fairy, 
                             D7   
Though her shoes were number nine, 
          C                 G           
Sometimes tripping, lightly skipping, 
       D7             G    
Lovely girl, my Clementine 
 
Ref. 
 
4. Drove she ducklings to the water 
                      D7       
Ev'ry morning just at nine, 
        C              G    
Hit her foot against a splinter, 
       D7             G           
Fell into the foaming brine. 
 
Ref. 
 
        G   
5. Ruby lips above the water, 
                         D7 
Blowing bubbles soft and fine, 
     C             G   
But alas, I was no swimmer, 
        D7           G   
Neither was my Clementine. 
 
Ref. 
 
        G         
6. In a churchyard near the canyon, 
                         D7   
Where the myrtle doth entwine, 
           C               G   
There grow rosies and some posies, 
     D7             G          
Fertilized by Clementine. 
 
Ref. 
 
             G          
7. Then, the miner, forty-niner, 
                       D7 
Soon began to fret and pine, 
           C                G      
Thought he oughter join his daughter, 
        D7             C  
So he's now with Clementine. 
 
Ref. 
 
          G                     
8. I'm so lonely, lost without her, 
                       D7 
Wish I'd had a fishing line, 
        C                G     
Which I might have cast about her, 
           D7             G    
Might have saved my Clementine. 
 
Ref. 
 
         G                     
9. In my dreams she still doth haunt me, 
                              D7     
Robed in garments soaked with brine, 
         C              G  
Then she rises from the waters, 
      D7            G           
And I kiss my Clementine. 
 
Ref. 
 
           G                   
10. Listen fellers, heed the warning 
                       D7 
Of this tragic tale of mine, 
    C           G      
Artificial respiration 
           D7             G  
Could have saved my Clementine. 
 
Ref. 
 
          G            
11. How I missed her, how I missed her, 
                      D7     
How I missed my Clementine, 
      C                 G  
Til I kissed her little sister, 
       D7           G        
And forgot my Clementine.
