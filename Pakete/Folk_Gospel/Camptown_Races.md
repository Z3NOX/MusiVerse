# Camptown Races

```
    G        
The Campptown ladies sing this song, 
D7        
Doo-da, Doo-da 
    G          
The Camptown racetrack's five miles long 
D7            G       
Oh, de doo-da day 
 
G         
Goin' to run all night 
C                G         
Goin' to run all day 
  G                 
I bet my money on a bob-tailed nag 
D7                  G                     
Somebody bet on the gray 
 
        G       
Oh, the long tailed filly and the big black horse, 
D7        
Doo-da, doo-da 
G        
Come to a mud hole and they all cut across, 
D7            G        
Oh, de doo-da day 
 
G         
Goin' to run all night 
C                G        
Goin' to run all day 
  G                 
I bet my money on a bob-tailed nag 
D7                  G                     
Somebody bet on the gray 
 
  G        
I went down there with my hat caved in, 
D7       
Doo-da, doo-da 
  G         
I came back home with a pocket full of tin 
D7            G        
Oh, de doo-da day 
 
G            
Goin' to run all night 
C            
Goin' to run all day 
  G            
I bet my money on a bob-tailed nag 
D7                  G            
Somebody bet on the gray
