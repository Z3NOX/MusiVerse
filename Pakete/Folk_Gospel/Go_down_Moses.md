# Go down Moses

```
     Am  E7        Am       
When Israel was in Egypt's land 
E7            Am 
Let my people go 
  Am         E7        Am  
Oppressed so hard they could not stand 
E7            Am 
Let my people go 
 
Refrain: 
Am       Dm     E7  
Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt's land 
Am                E7            Am 
Tell old Pharaoh, Let my people go 
 
   Am    E7      Am        
So Moses went to Egypt's land 
E7            Am 
Let my people go 
   Am       E7      Am  
To make old Pharaoh understand 
E7            Am 
Let my people go 
 
Ref. 
 
     Am        E7         Am                
Thus spake the Lord, bold Moses said, 
E7            Am 
"Let my people go, 
   Am        E7          Am 
If not, I'll strike your first born dead 
E7            Am 
"Let my people go"
