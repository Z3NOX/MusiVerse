# Billy Boy

```
    G    
Oh, where have you been, 
      G    
Billy Boy, Billy Boy? 
    G    
Oh, where have you been, 
         D7 
Charming Billy? 
       D7 
I have been to seek a wife, 
          D7 
She's the joy of my life, 
        D7 
She's a young thing 
                     G    
And cannot leave her mother. 
 
        G    
Did she ask you to come in, 
      G    
Billy Boy, Billy Boy? 
        G    
Did she ask you to come in, 
         D7 
Charming Billy? 
         D7 
Yes, she asked me to come in, 
          D7 
There's a dimple in her chin. 
        D7 
She's a young thing 
                     G    
And cannot leave her mother. 
 
        G    
Can she make a cherry pie, 
      G    
Billy Boy, Billy Boy? 
        G    
Can she make a cherry pie, 
         D7 
Charming Billy? 
        D7 
She can make a cherry pie, 
           D7 
Quick as a cat can wink an eye, 
        D7 
She's a young thing 
                     G    
And cannot leave her mother. 
 
    G    
How old is she, 
      G    
Billy Boy, Billy Boy? 
    G    
How old is she, 
         D7 
Charming Billy? 
            D7 
Three times six and four times seven, 
       D7 
Twenty-eight and eleven, 
        D7    
She's a young thing 
                     G    
And cannot leave her mother.
