# Red River Valley

```
          G    
From this valley they say you are going 
        G                               D7 
We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile 
         G                      C    
For they say you are taking the sunshine 
         G              D7         G    
That has brightened our path for a while 
 
Refrain: 
         G    
Come and sit by my side if you love me 
       G                 D7 
Do not hasten to bid me adieu 
      G                    C    
But remember the Red River Valley 
        G          D7           G    
And the cowboy who loved you so true 
 
          G   
Won't you think of the valley you're leaving 
       G                       D7 
Oh how lonely, how sad it will be? 
   G                              C    
Oh think of the fond heart you're breaking 
        G             D7         G    
And the grief you are causing to me 
 
Ref. 
 
       G    
As you go to your home by the ocean 
        G                        D7 
May you never forget those sweet hours 
        G                      C     
That we spent in the Red River Valley 
        G         D7              G     
And the love we exchanged mid the flowers 
 
Ref.
