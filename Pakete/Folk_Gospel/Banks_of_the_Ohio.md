# Banks of the Ohio

```
           G               D7 
I asked my love to go with me, 
                      G    
Just to walk a little way. 
          G                     C   
And as we walked, 'twas then we talked 
          G      D7        G    
Of our approaching wedding day. 
 
 
Ref.:  
          G                  D7 
Then only say that you'll be mine 
                        G   
And in no other arms entwine. 
       G                      C   
Down beside, where the waters flow 
            G       D7      G     
Down by the banks of the Ohio. 
 
         G                 D7 
I held a knife against her breast 
                         G    
As gently in my arms she pressed, 
        G                               C   
Crying "Willie, Oh Willie! Don't murder me 
          G        D7        G    
For I'm unprepared for eternity!" 
 
 
Ref. 
 
           G                 D7 
I took her by her lily white hand 
                           G    
And led her down where the waters stand; 
             G                  C    
I picked her up and pitched her in 
                G     D7       G    
And watched her as she floated down. 
 
 
Ref. 
 
          G                      D7 
I started home 'twixt twelve and one 
                               G    
Cryin' "Oh my God! What have I done? 
                               C    
I've murdered the only woman I love 
            G        D7     G    
Because she would not be my bride.
